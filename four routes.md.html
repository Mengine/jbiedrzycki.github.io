<blockquote>
<p>Four routes of cognitive evolution are distinguished: phylogenetic construction, in which natural selection produces qualitative change to the way a cognitive mechanism operates (language); phyloge- netic inflection, in which natural selection biases the input to a cognitive mechanism (imprinting and spatial memory); ontogenetic construction, in which developmental selection alters the way a cognitive mechanism operates (face recognition and theory of mind); and ontogenetic inflection, in which developmental selection changes the input to a cognitive mechanism (imitation). This framework integrates findings from evolutionary psychology (i.e., all research on the evolution of mentality and behavior). In contrast with human nativist evolutionary psychology, it recognizes the adaptive signifi- cance of developmental processes, conserves the distinction between cognitive and noncognitive mech- anisms, and encompasses research on human and nonhuman animals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article characterizes a problem for evolutionary psychology and proposes a framework for its solution. Human nativist evolu- tionary psychology (HNEP), which claims that the mind consists of many innate cognitive modules, is currently the most prominent and influential approach to the evolutionary analysis of cognition. The problem is that this relatively isolated research enterprise is having a disproportionate impact on the internal direction and external perception of the field, and yet its central claim is based on controversial assumptions and weak empirical evidence. Two kinds of errors are likely in this situation; there is a risk that examples of adaptive specialization will be forced into the mod- ularity mold, regardless of whether the data genuinely support this interpretation, and that all evolutionary psychology, not just HNEP, will begin to be seen as flawed. The four routes framework presented here allows these errors to be avoided because it ac- knowledges the existence of cognitive modules, and thereby the valid claims of HNEP, but also provides a simple taxonomy enabling identification of other kinds of adaptive specialization. It can be used by all evolutionary psychologists—those that study human and nonhuman animals, constructivists, and selection the- orists as well as nativists—to frame research questions, to com- municate empirical claims, and to compare and integrate their findings. The four routes framework may, therefore, play a heu- ristic role in the reorientation of evolutionary psychology away from module hunting and toward broader and more integrative analyses of the effects of evolution on cognition.</p>
<p>HNEP asserts that cognition is typically adaptive because phy- logenesis, the process of evolution through natural selection,1 has constructed a variety of domain-specific cognitive modules that are distinctive in terms of both their input (what information they process) and their mechanisms (how processing occurs; e.g., Cos- mides &amp; Tooby, 1992; Hirschfeld &amp; Gelman, 1994; Pinker, 1997). Each module processes information primarily or exclusively from one environmental domain (in which domains correspond to common-sense functional categories; e.g., language, social ex- change, and faces), and crucially, this information is processed by a cognitive mechanism that is distinctive in terms of the kinds of representations that it produces and manipulates and/or in relation to the rules that govern the production and manipulation of those representations.</p>
<p>HNEP represents a small subset of research that could be accurately described as evolutionary psychology (Daly &amp; Wilson, 1999; Heyes, 2000; Karmiloff-Smith, 1992; Lang, Sober, &amp; Strier, 2001; Shettleworth, 1998). The universal set includes a variety of disciplines investigating the behavior and mentality of human and nonhuman animals without exclusive commitment to symbolism, adaptationism, or nativism (e.g., animal cognition, animal learn- ing, behavioral ecology, behavioral neuroscience, comparative psychology, evolutionary epistemology, ethology, and primatol- ogy). There are also many research projects in developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuroscience that, although they do not address evolutionary issues explicitly, have a direct bearing on questions about the evolution of cognition.
The framework presented in this article rests on several assump- tions that are broadly compatible with those of HNEP: (a) Com- putationalism, or the information processing approach, provides an appropriate level of explanation for the proximal causes of a broad range of behavior; (b) not all characteristics have evolved, and not all evolved characteristics are adaptive (Futuyma, 1998), but ques- tions about adaptive function have heuristic value in psychology; and (c) cognitive processes are products of natural selection—their existence, like that of other highly complex phenotypic attributes, currently has no other plausible scientific explanation. However, HNEP tends to make two further assumptions that are not shared by the present analysis: (a) The distinction between cognitive and noncognitive mechanisms is unimportant—it is profitable to char- acterize all behavior-control mechanisms as symbolic, as involving rule-governed transformation of representations (Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 1994; Shapiro &amp; Epstein, 1998); and (b) natural selection is the only source of adaptive properties of cognitive processes— ontogenetic processes are merely means through which natural selection achieves adaptive change (Pinker, 1997).</p>
<p>It is argued, by contrast, that evidence from evolutionary psy- chology as a whole indicates that it is important for evolutionary analysis to conserve the distinction between cognitive and non- cognitive mechanisms and between behavior-control mechanisms that are guided by knowledge or expectancies and are subject to interference (e.g., reasoning and decision making) and those that are controlled by stimulation and are relatively immune to inter- ference (e.g., early feature detection and orienting reflexes). This latter distinction is important not only because it marks substantial differences between the way behavior-control mechanisms operate online and is especially useful in comparisons between human and nonhuman animals but also because cognitive and noncognitive mechanisms may differ in the degree to which they are prone to adaptive modification. In addition to being products of natural selection, some ontogenetic processes are themselves sources of adaptive change to cognitive mechanisms. In other words, HNEP’s monolithic conception of cognitive evolution, the view that cog- nitive evolution occurs through phylogenetic construction alone, ignores two important distinctions: between change to cognitive and noncognitive mechanisms and between phylogenetic and on- togenetic sources of adaptive modification. In combination, these distinctions circumscribe four major routes of cognitive evolution: phylogenetic construction, phylogenetic inflection, ontogenetic construction, and ontogenetic inflection.</p>
<p>The first section of this article presents the four routes frame- work in more detail, discusses potential objections, and considers in general terms the evidence required to classify examples of adaptive modification. The subsequent core of the article scruti- nizes evidence relating to a series of phenomena that have been claimed to be products of phylogenetic construction: imprinting, spatial memory, face processing, theory of mind, and imitation. In each case, it is argued that the proposed evidence of phylogenetic construction is at least equally compatible with the phenomenon having evolved via another, specified route. Thus, the second, third, and fourth sections present potential examples of phyloge- netic inflection, ontogenetic construction, and ontogenetic inflec- tion, respectively. Together, these sections illustrate the four routes framework and raise the possibility that phylogenetic construction is a relatively rare form of cognitive evolution.</p>
<h2 id="four-routes">Four Routes</h2>
<p>Four routes of cognitive evolution, four ways in which a cog- nitive process can change such that it produces more adaptive behavior, are distinguished here using two variables: the evolu- tionary source and the locus of the adaptive change (see Figure 1). The sources of change are natural selection, a gene-based evolu- tionary process, and developmental selection, a process of interaction between the developing organism and its environment dur-
ing ontogeny. The loci of change are the cognitive mechanism
itself, the computational device that processes information, and the
input to the cognitive mechanism, the type or range of information
3 processed.</p>
<p>A route is described as phylogenetic when the source is natural selection and as ontogenetic when the source is developmental selection. It is called construction when the locus is a cognitive mechanism and inflection when the locus is input to the cognitive mechanism. Thus, in phylogenetic construction, natural selection changes the mechanism of a cognitive process; in phylogenetic inflection, natural selection biases the input to an unchanged cog- nitive mechanism; in ontogenetic construction, developmental se- lection effects change to a cognitive mechanism; and in ontoge- netic inflection, developmental selection biases input without changing the mechanism.</p>
<p>A simple physiological analogy, in which a stomach stands for a cognitive mechanism, may clarify these distinctions. The amount of energy produced by the operation of a stomach could increase as a result of change in the activity of the enzymes that convert ingested material into nutrients (construction) or through alteration in the type and/or quantity of ingested material (inflection). A change in enzyme activity would be an example of phylogenetic construction if individuals with the new enzyme action had out- reproduced those with the old system because they have the new system. It would be ontogenetic construction if the shift from the old to the new system occurred within the lifetime of individuals and as a consequence of the material they ingested. Perhaps in this hypothetical digestive system, enzymes that are underused become unavailable, and those that are overused develop new properties. In the case of inflection, alteration in the type and/or quantity of ingested material would be phylogenetic inflection if it was due to the effects of natural selection on the creature’s jaws or dentition, structures that modulate input to the stomach. It would be onto- genetic inflection if the change in type and/or quantity of ingested material occurred within the lifetime of individuals and as a consequence of the material ingested. For example, consumption of the original set of materials may make owners of the stomach so big and strong that they can obtain a broader range or a new type of food.</p>
<p>Use of a variety of different taxonomic principles would make room for exploration of diversity in cognitive evolution. For ex- ample, cases could be classified according to whether adaptation occurs under cultural influence, according to whether it consists in alteration of cortical or subcortical mechanisms, or according to the range of taxa in which the adaptation occurs. The four routes framework uses the source (phylogenetic vs. ontogenetic) and locus (mechanism vs. input) of change because these are the broadest and most foundational distinctions already used by evo- lutionary psychologists in their research. What is distinctive about evolutionary analysis is that it investigates not just mature form but origins, and phylogenetic and ontogenetic processes are the two
4
major alternative sources of mature form. Similarly, although
many finer distinctions are possible, the divide between cognitive and noncognitive mechanisms is a fundamental division in post- behaviorist psychology (Neumann, 1984).</p>
<h2 id="source-phylogenetic-versus-ontogenetic">Source: Phylogenetic Versus Ontogenetic</h2>
<p>The source of an adaptive feature of a cognitive process is phylogenetic if that feature was specifically favored by natural selection—if, in the course of evolutionary history, cognitive phe- notypes that included the target feature out-reproduced those that lacked the feature and did so because they possessed the target feature. By contrast, the source of an adaptive feature of a cogni- tive process is ontogenetic if the feature was not specifically favored by natural selection but is instead generated in the course of development as a product of cognitive and other behavior- control processes operating on environmental input. In other words, the information that enables a system feature to fit its environment comes from natural selection in the case of phyloge- netic evolution and development in the case of ontogenetic evo- lution (D. T. Campbell, 1974).</p>
<p>In line with HNEP (Pinker, 1997) and nativist views of cogni- tion more generally (Chomsky, 1959; Fodor, 2000), an example of cognitive evolution is assumed to be phylogenetic if there is evidence of “poverty of the stimulus”—that the adaptive properties of the cognitive process could not have arisen through experience alone—or if there is evidence that the adaptive properties are genetically heritable. Conversely, it is classed as ontogenetic if the evidence suggests “wealth of the stimulus”—that the adaptive properties could be products of experience—and if there is no evidence that the adaptive properties are genetically heritable. Research relevant to the poverty or wealth of the stimulus com- pares the development of cognitive processes across species, cul- tures, and subgroups within a population. Wealth is indicated by correlated variation in experience and development, whereas pov- erty is implied by invariant development in the face of experiential diversity.</p>
<p>This distinction between phylogenetic and ontogenetic sources is not a crude nature–nurture dichotomy. It acknowledges that, like all other phenotypic attributes, cognitive processes are produced jointly by genetic and developmental processes (Mayr, 1974). The information obtained through natural selection and stored in the genotype cannot produce a phenotype without developmental pro- cesses of some kind, and development cannot yield phenotypic outcomes that are outside the potential of the genotype. However, development is not always tightly genetically constrained or can- alized (Waddington, 1959) such that it does all and only what natural selection “desires.” Development can produce outcomes, some of them adaptive, that were not anticipated (not specifically favored) by natural selection, and these outcomes may be said to have an ontogenetic source (D. T. Campbell, 1974; Karmiloff- Smith, 1992).</p>
<p>A morphological example may clarify the distinction between phylogenetic and ontogenetic sources of adaptive change: Many people who worked in the ancient Chinese silk industry had serrated finger nails. The end of each nail had a zigzag shape, and the points were used to tease silk fibers. There is no doubt that the silk workers’ fingernails were joint products of natural selection and developmental processes, but it is still legitimate to ask which of these kinds of processes was responsible for the serrated shape. In principle, this feature could have had a phylogenetic source. Over generations in a silk-working subpopulation, people who inherited a mutation for serrated nails may have out-reproduced those who did not because they were more efficient at silk pro- cessing. Alternatively, and much more plausibly, the serrated shape may have had an ontogenetic source. The silk workers had the same fingernail-relevant genes as other members of the pop- ulation, and these genes had not been favored by natural selection because they contributed to the development of nails that could, in certain environments, become serrated and assist in silk produc- tion. Instead, the silk workers learned, initially by trial and error and subsequently through social learning, that serrated nails facil- itate silk teasing and therefore adopted the practice of clipping their nails into multiple points. In an analogous sense, whereas every cognitive process is a joint product of natural selection and developmental processes, a feature of a cognitive process, such as its input domain or some property of its mechanism, may be adaptive by virtue of either phylogenesis or ontogenesis.</p>
<h2 id="ontogenetic-evolution">Ontogenetic evolution</h2>
<p>In this article, a cognitive process is said to have evolved when there is reason to believe that it has changed systematically over time in a way that increases the adaptedness of the cognitive system’s behavior. According to this usage, both phylogenetically and ontogenetically generated change to cognitive processes is evolutionary. Some readers may prefer to reserve the term evolu- tion for change guided by natural selection, but this is a purely terminological issue. Phylogenetic construction, phylogenetic in- flection, ontogenetic construction, and ontogenetic inflection may be regarded as four routes to the adaptive modification or adaptive specialization (Rozin &amp; Kalat, 1971) rather than the evolution of cognitive processes, without alteration to the substance of the debate. However, it is important to note that the present usage is not eccentric and does not vacuously equate evolution with change.</p>
<p>There is a long tradition in evolutionary psychology that de- scribes ontogenetic adaptive modification as evolution (e.g., D. T. Campbell, 1974; Edelman, 1987; Heyes &amp; Hull, 2001; Hull, Lang- man, &amp; Glenn, 2001; James, 1880; Plotkin &amp; Odling-Smee, 1981;
5
Skinner, 1981, 1984), and this terminology does not entail that all
developmental changes in behavior are examples of cognitive evolution. Experience-based changes in behavior do not represent cognitive evolution when (a) they result from acquisition of infor- mation via cognitive processes but are not associated with system- atic, adaptive change to the input or mechanisms of cognitive processes (e.g., learning facts such as that the pyramids are in Egypt) and (b) they involve systematic change in the input to, or mechanisms of, a cognitive process, but this change is unlikely to promote reproductive fitness (e.g., becoming an expert train spot- ter). Thus, if there are systematic, experience-based changes to cognitive processes that are neutral or deleterious with respect to fitness, they would not constitute examples of ontogenetic evolution.</p>
<p>Ontogenetic evolution/developmental selection occurs in the immune system (Hull et al., 2001). Natural selection, gene-based evolution, provides the body with a basic set of B cells, the cells that produce antibodies against infection. However, this set is wholly inadequate as a defense against the millions of pathogens to which a body can be exposed. To deal with the full range, in the course of an individual’s lifetime, B cells from the original set that find their pathogens undergo mutation and division. Some of the new B cells that result from this process of developmental selec- tion are better able than the originals to engage with pathogens, and these are available in large numbers to deal with reinfection.</p>
<p>Little is known about developmental selection of cognitive processes. There are few general theories (e.g., D. T. Campbell, 1974; Karmiloff-Smith, 1992), and in individual cases (e.g., face processing and theory of mind), it would be desirable to know much more about the type of experience that is important, the kinds of environment in which this experience is obtained, the sequence of states traversed by the cognitive process in the course of its evolution, and the principles that govern transition between these states. These are research priorities for evolutionary psychol- ogy and developmental psychology alike. However, to ascribe cognitive change to ontogenetic evolution begs no more ques- tions—it is no more of a promissory note (Sperber, 1996) than ascribing cognitive change to phylogenetic evolution. Phylogenetic accounts of the evolution of cognitive processes seldom if ever specify a genetic mechanism, identify with any precision the environmental conditions that provided selection pressure, or in- dicate transitional stages between the ancestral and the current state of the cognitive process (Davies, 1999; Richardson, 1996). Relative to the study of morphological and anatomical character- istics, ontogenetic and phylogenetic evolutionary analyses of cog- nition are in their infancy.</p>
<h2 id="locus-input-versus-mechanism">Locus: Input Versus Mechanism</h2>
<p>Changes to the input of a cognitive process consist of alterations in its “catchment area”—in the identity or extent of the environ- mental domain from which it typically receives information or in the amount of information it receives from a given domain. By contrast, changes to the mechanism of a cognitive process alter the way in which information is processed, the way in which the mechanism operates.</p>
<p>Cases of adaptive specialization of cognitive processes are
classed as constructive when there is evidence that the cognitive
mechanism in question is qualitatively different from those that
process different information in the same species or the same
information in different species. This typically consists of exper-
iments showing that for the focal process the relations between
environmental input and behavioral output are distinctive in a way
that can be explained only by supposing that the cognitive mech-
anism processes information using distinctive rules and/or repre-
sentations. Neurobiological research contributes to this enterprise,
but neural localization of a cognitive mechanism is not, in itself,
evidence that the mechanism is qualitatively distinct (Sherry &amp;
Schacter, 1987). Cases are identified as inflectional if there is no
compelling evidence that the target cognitive mechanism is qual-
itatively distinct but there is evidence that input to the cognitive
mechanism is being biased in favor of a particular environmental
6 domain</p>
<p>In contemporary psychology, the operation of a cognitive mech- anism is typically characterized with reference to its rules and representations. Accordingly, the four routes framework assumes that qualitative change to a cognitive mechanism consists of alter- ation of the kinds of representations it produces and/or the rules that describe the production and manipulation of those represen- tations. However, this characterization does not assume that all cognitive mechanisms are rule following, that is, that they embody or “know” the rules of their own operation in the way that a cook knows a recipe. Nor, therefore, does it assume that representations are symbolic, that is, that they are representations by virtue of the way in which they are treated by rules internal to the system (contra, e.g., Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 1994; Fodor, 1975). Instead of adopting this symbolist view, which is committed to a digital computer metaphor, the present analysis assumes that rules de- scribe the operation of a cognitive mechanism but that, like the rules of planetary motion, they are not necessarily consulted by the system. Accordingly, the present analysis assumes that a state of a system is a representation if it stands for another state of the system or of the environment and if it is the biological function of the system in question to produce such representations (Dretske, 1988; Hatfield, 1991; Kosslyn &amp; Hatfield, 1984; Millikan, 1984). For example, a pattern of neural activation in the visual system represents certain spatial properties of the environment because the pattern is a state of a system whose function it is to represent such properties (Hatfield, 1991). This “biopsychological” conception of representations is compatible with integrative evolutionary analy- sis because it focuses attention on function (Shapiro &amp; Epstein, 1998), embraces both connectionist and symbolist uses of the term in psychology, and avoids exclusive commitment to the symbolist explanatory framework that is alien to many biologists.</p>
<p>Inflection, adaptive change to the input of a cognitive mecha- nism, can result solely from processing of earlier input (without any alteration in the way that cognitive or noncognitive mecha- nisms operate), or it can be a consequence of changes to a non- cognitive mechanism that modulates input to the cognitive mech- anism. Although they may be described with reference to rules and representations (as defined above), noncognitive mechanisms dif- fer from cognitive mechanisms in being automatic or bottom up. They are controlled by stimulation rather than by knowledge or expectancies, are relatively immune to interference, and do not necessarily give rise to conscious awareness. The primary exam- ples of noncognitive mechanisms are those involved in sensory and motor processes such as early feature detection, orienting reflexes, and control of bodily functions (Neumann, 1984).</p>
<p>Adaptive change to the input of a cognitive mechanism can also be a consequence of change to the mechanism itself. For example, by virtue of having new rules and/or representations, a cognitive mechanism may be more selective, that is, capable of processing information from one domain exclusively or at a higher rate than information from other domains. In these cases, the four routes framework would classify the change as constructive rather than inflectional. Adaptive change to the input of a cognitive process is classified as inflection when it is not a consequence of change to the cognitive mechanism.</p>
<p>Proponents of HNEP sometimes write as if the division of minds into domain-specific cognitive modules, and therefore the wide- spread occurrence of phylogenetic construction, could be deduced from the theory of evolution by natural selection (e.g., Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 1994). However, whereas there are arguments for and against the adaptive value of phylogenetic construction (and each of the other three evolutionary routes), the extent of its influence on cognitive phenotypes is understood ultimately to be an empir- ical question and one that can be resolved only on a case by case basis (Cosmides, 1989; Shapiro &amp; Epstein, 1998). Therefore, the remainder of this article focuses on cases, both to demonstrate how examples of cognitive evolution can be classified as phylogenetic or ontogenetic and constructive or inflectional and to show that the occurrence of phylogenetic construction is typically inferred from weak empirical evidence. Language is exceptional in this respect. Although this case is not conclusive (e.g., Bates &amp; MacWhinney, 1982; Chomsky, 1986; Elman et al., 1996; Fodor, 2000; Gould, 1991), there is strong evidence that human language acquisition is guided by a phylogenetically constructed cognitive mechanism (Pinker, 1994).</p>
<h2 id="phylogenetic-inflection">Phylogenetic Inflection</h2>
<p>Phylogenetic inflection occurs when natural selection biases the input to a cognitive mechanism by changing an upstream noncog- nitive process. Two examples will be discussed in this section: filial imprinting and spatial memory in food-storing birds. These cases are of particular interest because they are, respectively, the oldest and best potential examples of phylogenetic construction in nonhuman animals (Lorenz, 1937; Sherry &amp; Schacter, 1987; Shettleworth, 1993, 1998), and yet many decades of elegant, interdisciplinary research has failed to provide compelling evi- dence that either involves a qualitatively distinct cognitive mechanism.</p>
<h3 id="imprinting">Imprinting</h3>
<p>Filial imprinting is the process by which the social behavior of a young animal, typically a bird, becomes limited to a particular object or class of objects, usually its mother or conspecifics (Bolhuis, 1991). Lorenz (1937) suggested that filial imprinting has three characteristics indicative of its occurring via a learning mechanism qualitatively distinct from those of instrumental and Pavlovian conditioning. He claimed that filial imprinting (a) oc- curs without reinforcement, (b) is confined to a critical period in development (that it is possible during the first few days of life and not subsequently), and (c) is irreversible—once formed a prefer- ence for an imprinted object cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Subsequent experimental research has led each of these conclu- sions to be revised. First, evidence that imprinting is susceptible to blocking and overshadowing suggests that it is a form of Pavlovian conditioning in which the motion of the imprinting object acts as an unconditioned stimulus, or reinforcer, that becomes associated with static properties of the object, such as color and shape (Bolhuis, De Vos, &amp; Kruijt, 1990). Second, the critical period for imprinting, now described as a sensitive period, has turned out to be much more flexible than Lorenz anticipated and to be controlled to a large degree by experiential factors. There is evidence that the sensitive period is self-terminating; it is terminated by the estab- lishment of an object preference because this preference entails that the bird will avoid exposure to alternative potential objects of imprinting (Bolhuis, 1991). Finally, under most conditions, im- printing is reversible. Birds subjected to two successive imprinting procedures in the laboratory shift their preference from the object of the first to the object of the second unless the former includes head and neck features and the latter does not (Bolhuis, 1991; M. H. Johnson &amp; Horn, 1988).</p>
<p>As a consequence of these discoveries and many others, con- temporary models of imprinting cast it as a behavioral phenome- non mediated by species-general and domain-general mechanisms of learning. This is true even of Bateson and Horn’s (Bateson, 2000; Bateson &amp; Horn, 1994) model of imprinting, which is not only one of the strongest theories but also one of the most con- servative in the degree to which it retains elements of Lorenz’s (1937) original conception of imprinting (cf. McLaren, Kaye, &amp; Mackintosh, 1989). Bateson and Horn’s model implicates three processes in imprinting: analysis (sensory), recognition (cogni- tive), and execution (motor). The recognition process learns the features of the imprinting object, and according to the model, it achieves this end via the same mechanisms, the same learning rules, that mediate visual recognition of nonimprinting objects in birds and other vertebrates. It is a special characteristic of the noncognitive analysis process, not of the recognition process, that renders imprinting adaptive for precocial birds by making it more likely that they will form attachments to conspecifics than to other objects. The analysis process operates such that head and neck stimuli have privileged access to the recognition process (M. H. Johnson &amp; Horn, 1988). The elements of the analysis process that are responsible for head and neck detection mature earlier than detectors of other features (M. H. Johnson, Bolhuis, &amp; Horn, 1985) and thereby create an input bias to the recognition process favoring head and neck stimuli. Deprivation experiments have indicated that the early maturation of head and neck detectors does not depend on visual experience, and therefore it is likely that natural selection has scheduled their development as an adaptation pro- moting maintenance of contact with caregivers.</p>
<p>Thus, the original evidence that imprinting is a product of phylogenetic construction, which convinced Lorenz (1937) of the distinctiveness of imprinting, has been largely undermined, and the results of recent research are more consistent with the view that imprinting evolved through phylogenetic inflection. Therefore, current theory and evidence suggest that in the case of imprinting, natural selection has biased the input to a cognitive process by altering an upstream noncognitive process and that it has not changed the cognitive mechanism—in this case, the learning rules—that processes this input. It is possible, and indeed likely, that these learning rules, the same ones that mediate associative learning in a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, were themselves products of phylogenetic construction early in evolu- tionary history, but current evidence suggests that it was phyloge- netic inflection, rather than phylogenetic construction, that made imprinting distinctive with respect to other forms of associative learning.</p>
<h2 id="spatial-memory-in-food-storing-birds">Spatial Memory in Food-Storing Birds</h2>
<p>Certain birds, such as Clark’s nutcrackers and marsh tits, that experience seasonal variation in the availability of food scatter hoard for winter survival; they store food in small quantities at a large number of locations. Cache retrieval has been demonstrated to involve memory (Clayton &amp; Krebs, 1994), and these birds have been reported to perform better on tests of spatial memory than related species that cache less assiduously (Kamil, Balda, &amp; Olson, 1994; Olson, Kamil, Balda, &amp; Nims, 1995). There is also evidence hat lesions of the hippocampus impair memory for cache sites (Sherry &amp; Vaccarino, 1989) and that species that depend heavily on food storing for winter survival have larger hippocampi than related species (Krebs, Sherry, Healy, Perry, &amp; Vaccarino, 1989).
These data would provide evidence of phylogenetic construction if they showed that natural selection has given rise to a cognitive mechanism, based in the hippocampus, that processes spatial in- formation using rules and/or representations that differ from those used to process nonspatial information. For example, the mecha- nism processing spatial information may be distinctive in gener- ating and manipulating map-like representations, which allocen- trically code unexplored space as well as objects (O’Keefe &amp; Nadel, 1978).</p>
<p>A recent review of the experimental literature (Bolhuis &amp; MacPhail, 2001; MacPhail &amp; Bolhuis, 2001) casts doubt both on the claim that food-storing birds have superior spatial memory and on the hypothesis that any such superiority is due to the operation of a distinctive, hippocampus-based memory mechanism. The review found that the performance of food-storing birds in spatial memory tasks is not consistently superior to that of related non- storing species (storers showed significantly better performance in four types of task, whereas nonstorers were superior in two others) and that in those studies in which storers were better than non- storers, the effect did not vary with retention interval, implying that it was not due to a difference in memory. Furthermore, although there is solid evidence that in adulthood food-storing species have larger hippocampi than nonstorers (Healy, Clayton, &amp; Krebs, 1994; Healy &amp; Krebs, 1993) and that experience in a spatial task promotes more hippocampal enlargement in storers than in nonstorers (Clayton, 1995), hippocampal growth has not been firmly linked with improvement in spatial memory. For example, marsh tits (storers) are better than blue tits (nonstorers) at revisit- ing locations where they previously saw food, but this effect is present before as well as after experience-dependent hippocampal growth (Clayton, 1995).</p>
<p>The phylogenetic inflection account of spatial memory in food- storing birds assumes, in common with most researchers in this field and in spite of the problems identified by MacPhail and Bolhuis (2001), that storers are generally better than nonstorers in spatial memory tasks and that this is connected in some way with hippocampal volume. However, the phylogenetic inflection hy- pothesis also takes account of the fact, underlined by MacPhail and Bolhuis (2001), that there is no compelling evidence that storer superiority in spatial tasks is due to the use of a qualitatively distinct memory mechanism to remember spatial rather than non- spatial information. The phylogenetic inflection account suggests that in response to pressure from seasonal variation in food supply, natural selection has produced storing behavior by changing non- cognitive sensory and motor processes. These changes increase the total volume of information entering memory mechanisms that process both spatial and nonspatial stimuli, and they increase the proportion of this information that is spatial, by promoting detec- tion of spatial stimuli and provoking behavior that scatters food. Performance of this behavior creates for the hoarder an environ- ment in which there is a large amount of (spatial) information to be remembered. The hippocampus grows as it deals with the higher volume of information entering the memory system, but neither its potential to grow as spatial information is memorized nor the cognitive mechanisms that it implements have been changed by natural selection relative to those used by nonstoring species to remember spatial and nonspatial information.</p>
<p>Thus, the phylogenetic inflection hypothesis does not assume that the hippocampus is a totally general memory mechanism or contradict the ecological view of spatial memory in food-storing birds. Rather, it suggests that at least in these species, the hip- pocampus processes nonspatial as well as spatial information and that the mechanisms that have been changed by natural selection to meet ecological demands are noncognitive input processes.</p>
<p>Support for the idea that storer superiority in spatial tasks is due to the effects of natural selection on sensory processes that pro- mote detection of spatial stimuli, rather than on memory, comes from dissociation tests (Brodbeck, 1994; Brodbeck &amp; Shettle- worth, 1995; Clayton &amp; Krebs, 1994). In these tests, birds see food hidden in a visually distinctive object at a specific location, and before they are allowed to search for and consume the bait, the object is moved to a new location and replaced with one of a different appearance. Nonstorers go as often to the object as to the location at which they previously saw food, but storers consistently return to the original location. In combination with the absence of effects of retention interval in studies comparing storers and non- storers in spatial tasks, these results suggest that spatial cues are more readily detected than object-specific cues in storing birds but not in nonstoring birds (MacPhail &amp; Bolhuis, 2001).</p>
<p>The phylogenetic inflection hypothesis is also consistent with the results of a study showing that the posterior hippocampus of London taxi drivers, who have extensive navigational experience, is larger than that of control subjects and that hippocampal volume in this group correlates with number of years spent as a taxi driver (Maguire et al., 2000). It is possible, but unlikely, that London cabbies represent a genetically distinct subpopulation naturally selected for hippocampal growth potential. Therefore, these find- ings suggest that substantial hippocampal growth can result from experience alone, that is, in the absence of any constructive ma- nipulation of spatial memory by natural selection.</p>
<p>In summary, the phylogenetic construction account of spatial memory in food-storing birds has not been discredited. However, current evidence is equally consistent with the phylogenetic in- flection hypothesis, which suggests that spatial memory in food- storing birds depends on domain-general and taxon-general pro- cesses of learning and memory that have acquired their adaptive properties through the effects of natural selection on upstream noncognitive processes. The four routes model provides a common evolutionary framework for comparison of these hypothesis and, by highlighting that current data do not distinguish between them, indicates that in spite of confident claims to the contrary, it is not yet known whether spatial memory in food-storing birds has been shaped by phylogenetic construction, phylogenetic inflection, or both of these evolutionary processes.</p>
